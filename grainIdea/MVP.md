## the basics needs:
First, we need a "profile" builder. connected to another social network.

then there is a search on Facebook \Insta \Redit etc for comments over topics that are in the user scope (or by choice).

grab those comments (after verifying its totally legal etc)

without pictures, without even name, it doesn't really matter, just the comment, varchar I guess. CSV.

I understand I'll have to learn Python for that.


I actually thought of trying to learn just how to read what real developers did and focus on learning the configurations.

Do let me know if it's a stupid idea/



Ok go on to the MVP:

we had our basic GRAB


Now we want to represent each comment according to its size and to have a "box" that the comment lives in.

each comment is a floating item that the player can drag and drop.


again in short - 
auto search for leading topics among the pile - and moving those comments to a bach.


The user should have a set of tools, that with them he is mining in the pile.

"Grouping" - drag a comment on top of another comment and link them together as comments who are bringing the same value to the game.
and they'll fold under each other. The user should give it a name, later on, it will be represented in colours and shapes.



the last thing is to be able to create a connection between those groups. and give this connection a name.


I think that with those tools colocWE will be able to start the first test.
