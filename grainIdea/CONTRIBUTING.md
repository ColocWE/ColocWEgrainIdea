It would be great if you could recommend other open-source projects that can be useful for configurations.

I think that if I'll take a basic "comments" add on I would be able to learn eventually how to make them float. HTML and javascript. and to make connections between each other after

so - if you think it shouldn't be a comment thingy and it should be some game that will work with it.

just tell me!

Start by giving your input / ideas / criticism on the colocWE project. everithing goes.
<br>
if you realise what is the <b>goal</b> - I bet you will have an opinion on how it can be achieved.

Since my coding capability is limited minus, please be forgiving.
I am actually learning in these very moments, for no other reason than this project :)


Meanwhile, I will thank you if you will help me think this thing together.


Challenge me with questions about colocWE,  I'm sure there are things I missed.


Please bring more opinions and ideas into the project.


that would be wonderful.



If you also can advise me of the tools and languages I should start learning.
